Welcome to the Rf.Lotto project!

Most of the value comes from lotto data from germany in machine readable format. 
As of today (18.02.2012) it contains 3190 drawings over a period of 57 years.

The first 35 drawings do not include the "Zusatzzahl". 
Starting with January 2001, Wednesday and Saturday drawings are available. Before that only Saturday drawings are available.

I am starting adding Wednesday drawings from end of 1999 to the past (current position: 03.11.1999). Before 2000 there were 2 drawings every Wednesday.

Data comes from the website die "lottozahlen.de":http://lottozahlen.de, however in a very machine unfriendly fashion.
